## Features

Below you will find the different features that is used in my project. The value the features used provide to my website and why it useful for my users in navigating through the website.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

## Design

- ## Design Philosophy
- The design of the website is centered around a minimalistic approach, using a neutral color palette and simple typography to ensure that the focus remains on the content. This approach is based on the idea that less is more, allowing users to navigate and use the site with ease.

- ## Colour Scheme
- The color scheme was inspired by minimalist Scandinavian design, favoring neutral tones like white, grey, and black to create a clean, clutter-free space for users to focus on content. These colors are easy on the eyes, ensuring that the website is comfortable for long-term use, especially for a site about productivity.

- The primary colour used is white, black and grey to create a simple contrast for the eyes for my users and also work in all screens.

- The pink accent color was selected for its ability to stand out against the neutral background, creating a sense of urgency and action. It was specifically applied to the sign-up button to encourage conversions, drawing the user's attention immediately to the call to action.

- I changed my initial shade of colour in my footer from grey to pink accent color in order to have a nice contrast between the greys and black, hence why I opted for all three shades to be used throughout my websites pages. Another reason for the change was due to inconsistency accross different pages specifically index page with other pages to have a consistent theme colors.

- ## Wireframes & Mockups
  Wireframes or mockups were used in order to help me visualize the layout and user interface (UI) before development begins.The wireframes for Productivity website were produced in [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com). Below are the initial designs for key sections of the website.

## User Experience

- ## Introduction

  - This Project was really important for me to showcase a website that offers a life-hack tips and guidance for its users. It was created on the purpose of setting up a user-friendly website but that also pushes individuals to want to take a step forward towards productivity. I had in mind to create a practical, simple website that increased satisfaction for my users.

- ## Design Principles

  - My website was created to be user friendly all the design choice is picked in mind to appear aesthetics and user interactive to my users. I followed a minimalist design framework.

- ## User-Focused Approach

  - I did a study on different existing website for life-hack and compared how user friendly they were and which ones attracted more visitors. I noticed that simple text and website that prompts action and appeared aesthetically good was a winner. I therefore created my website very minimal.

- ## User Interface (UI)

* The color theme I used for the website was quiet minimal scandinavian grey/white and black. But to stand out and attract visitors to stay on the page, I added a pink button and a interactive map. The choice of font used was Source Sans Pro and Lora, I knew that the combination together would be user friendly and appear well to my users. Modern and also simple font.

- ## Interaction Design

  - Buttons, navigting menu, map and hoover on elements was used in this website. It is userfriendly and intented to increase user experience. The landing page includes an animating effect to grab users attention in the first few seconds looking at the website. This is used to enhance usability.

- ## Screen Responsiveness

  - I ensured a mobile friendly responsive website by styling my pages in accordance to different screen. Mobile screen is adjusted through setting a media css style that suits the screen. For Ipad and laptop I also used a seperate styling to suit the screen for my users.

- ## Accessibility

  - My project can be accessible to users and online platform search through my use of #keywords to increase user ability to find my page. This includes #productivity.

- ## Performance Optimization

  - To ensure a smooth interaction in my pages, I set up scroll-behavior: smooth; in my css.

- ## Future Enhancements

  - I believe my Productivity website is a good start, however I believe there could be a lot of improvment that could include in the future. Any improvement tips I would be happy to hear from my users or other developers.

  - The integrated map on the contact page has a bug that is extended a little bit towards one side of the page. This bug was due to the iframe and I was unable to fix it, it doesn't belong to me as i found it on google.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

- ## Technology Used

  - Auto Close Tag:
    It is an extension that automatically helps to add HTML close tag.

  - Prettier:
    It is also an extension that automatically formats, as it enforces a consistent style by parsing.

- ## Bugs

### Known Bugs

- Iframe: The Google Map used occassionally won't load as I would like it. Becuase it is an Iframe from Google my setting in CSS will not automatically apply perfectly as it does not belong to me.

### Validation Bugs

- Validation Issues: This is a previous issue that i had to manually improve. It was caused by the use of Prettier (extension) formating, this showed up as validation issues in "Validator.w3" HTML validator, since "Prettier" added "/> towards the end of all my codes. This was an issue that i resolved and I am aware to not use Prettier extensions again. Now I have no Validation issue for my Website "Productivity".
