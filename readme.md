## User Experience

- ## Introduction
     * This Project was really important for me to showcase a website that offers a life-hack tips and guidance for its users. It was created on the purpose of setting up a user-friendly website but that also pushes individuals to want to take a step forward towards productivity. I had in mind to create a practical, simple website that increased satisfaction for my users. 

- ## Design Principles
     * My website was created to be user friendly all the design choise is picked in mind to appear aesthetics and user interactive to my users. I followed a minimalist design framework. 

- ## User-Focused Approach
    * I did a study on different existing website for life-hack and compared how user friendly they were and which ones attracted more visitors. I noticed that simple text and website that promts action and appeared aestheticly good was a winner. I therefore created my website very minimal.

- ## User Interface (UI)
 * The color theme I used for the website was quiet minimal scandinavian grey/white and black. But to stand out and attract visitors to stay on the pay I added a pink button and a interactive map. The choice of font used was Source Sans Pro and Lora, I knew that the combination together would be user friendly and appear well to my users. Modern and also simple font.

- ## Interaction Design
    * Buttons, navigting menu, map and hoover on elements was used in this website. It is userfriendly and intented to increase user experience. The landing page includes an aniumating effect to grab users attention in the first few seconds looking at the website. This is used to enhance usability. 

- ## Screen Responsiveness
    * I ensured a mobile friendly responsive website by styling my pages in accordance to different screen. Mobile screen is adjusted through setting a media css style that suits the sreen. For Ipad and laptop I also used a seperate styling to suit the screen for my users.

- ## Accessibility
   * My project can be accessible to users and online platform search through my use of #keywords to increase user ability to find my page. This includes #productivity.

- ## Testing and Iteration
  * In order to increase my projects user experience, I conducted testing for my html and css for all my pages. 
    * For HTML validation, I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/).
    * For CSS validation, I used the [W3C CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/).




- ## Performance Optimization
    * To ensure a smooth interaction in my pages, I set up scroll-behavior: smooth; in my css.

- ## Future Enhancements
    * I believe my Productivity website is a good start, however I believe there could be a lot of improvment that could include in the future. Any improvment tips I would be happy to hear from my users or other developers.

    * The integrated map on the contact page has a bug that is extended a little bit towards one side of the page. This bug was due to the iframe and I was unable to fix it, it doesn't belong to me as i found it on google.
